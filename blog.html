                Artificial Intelligence has become a part of our daily lives. U.S. startyups including Osari, Kindred
                and Vicarious are already using this technology for the manufacturing. Every big company and
                organization is focusing on improving the customer experience and modernizing their business actions by
                using AI.
            </p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is driven by the arrival of Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa. GAP, an apparel
                brand used Kindredâ€™s Technology for automating distribution parts. For many other reason, Artificial
                intelligence will have a big breakout moment in the field of manufacturing
