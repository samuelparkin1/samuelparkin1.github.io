                Artificial Intelligence has become a part of our daily lives. U.S. startyups including Osari, Kindred
                and Vicarious are already using this technology for the manufacturing. Every big company and
                organization is focusing on improving the customer experience and modernizing their business actions by
                using AI.
            </p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is driven by the arrival of Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa. GAP, an apparel
                brand used Kindredâ€™s Technology for automating distribution parts. For many other reason, Artificial
                intelligence will have a big breakout moment in the field of manufacturing</p>

                A system called Amazon Go which uses Internet of Things (IoT), recently launched by the Amazon. This
                system uses Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine vision technologies that allows the customers to buy
                the product without doing the manual check out.
            </p>
            <p>People expect that with the 5G, Iot applications and connected devices will reach high. More vision
                technologies and sensors will be used by Environment, allowing more accessible IoT solutions.

                Automation is at the highest peaks in latest in information technologies trends. As we all know that
                numerous technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Robotics and Cloud computing are also
                growing at a high scale. Software consulting companies such as manufacturing, software enterprises,
                manufacturing and banking are also going forward with the implementation of Automation.

            <p>
                Businesses are moving towards the cloud solutions. The demand of edge Computing processing power is
                increasing.Chip Startups Graphcore (U.K), Wave Computing (U.S), SambaNova (U.S) and Syntiant (U.S) have
                made architecture for tackling the growing demand.
            </p>
            <p>Edge Computing is especially designed for solving the big data problems in such a way for bypassing the
                latency which is affected by Cloud Computing.</p>
