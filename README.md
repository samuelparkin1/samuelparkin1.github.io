### Tech stack.

In the **Design** stage, Balsamiq Wireframe was used to generate digital sketches of the ideas and concept to be used on the portfolio.

While in the **Create** stage, VS studio was used to write the HTML and CSS code. Throughout the **Create** stage GIT was continuously used as the repository system. At the final stage of creating the portfolio XML-Sitemaps was used to create the portfolios XML code.

When the site was ready to **Deploy**, the final code was uploaded to GitHub in order to be view by the web. The Lighthouse tool helped ensure that the Portfolio page has adequate performance and accessibility. To improve search visibility, Google Search Console was used to help in the measuring of the portfolios search traffic and performance.
